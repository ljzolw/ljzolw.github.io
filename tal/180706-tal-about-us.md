## The story

The story starts with a group of friends who wanted to do more than just write code.

We wanted to deliver value to people. We wanted to solve problems and have a lot of fun while doing it.

Real-world problems we wanted to solve are complex beasts - they require human approach, technical mastery and abilities to understand what are we really solving.

From the fusion of human approach, technical mastery and a quest for understanding the Third Alloy was forged. The place in the internet dedicated to taking multidimensional problems and cracking them, using any means necessary.

Our engineering background and the quest for getting better led us to measuring things we were doing - and to getting better and better.

Third Alloy.

"The fusion of Humans and Engineering combined into System - to deliver Observable Value."      //prototypowy slogan

## Why should you keep in touch?

* Every single one of us has above 5 years of experience in the IT world, in different companies. We have seen quite a lot.
* We have been working both in the engineering roles, in the human-related roles and in business-related roles. We can navigate those worlds.
* We are not focused on technologies nor on specific actions. We are focused on finding root causes of problems - and on delivering appropriate solutions.
* We want to get better every day, and we want to help you get the best possible solution under the given constraints.
