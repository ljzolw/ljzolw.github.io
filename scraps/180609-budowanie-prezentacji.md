## STEP 1: Ideation

### 1. Stakeholders

1. who are they? What is their story?
2. what do they DO?
3. functional, emotional, social
4. what is in this product for THEM (probably filled past 'point 3')
5. who/what is our CUSTOMER and who is NOT (while being a STAKEHOLDER)?

### 2. Vision

1. what do I want out of it?
1. what do they want out of it?
    1. where is the **CARROT**? (better world)
    1. where is the **PAIN**? (current reality or fear)
    1. where is the difference between _now_ and _ideal state_?
        1. this is called a 'gap', uses carrots and pain
1. what do I want for our relation?
1. what do I absolutely NOT want?
1. how do I fill the gap?

### 3. Values

1. what problem are we solving, really?
    1. remember that 'gap' thing? Select a proper subset
    2. you WANT to identify all objections / barriers, too
1. what are the dimensions?
    1. -ilities; do not overoptimize and kill the product
1. what do we want to achieve?
    1. in other words, OBJECTIVES.
1. how can we quantify all that?
    1. quantify the Values
1. you MAY prioritize if you have too much here
    1. Impact Estimation Table or easier - Eisenhower

### 4. Validation

1. did it resonate with the target group?
1. did it actually solve a problem we tried to solve?
1. can they name what it did?
1. did we have "you're right" (bad) or "that's right" (good) moment?
1. did the focus group listen (bad) or ask questions and relate to their issues (good)?

### 5. Proof

1. how will they know they have received value?
1. how can they see the newfound knowledge was useful?

## STEP 2: Design

### 1. Skeleton

1. Agenda, Teaser, Story
1. Spine (Topic 1 solving a Problem)
    1. Problem -> Solution
    2. "what if..." leading to Topic 2
1. Supporting Topic 2
    1. Problem -> Solution
    2. "what if..." leading to Topic 3
1. Closing Topic 3
    1. Problem -> Solution
    2. Add some barriers and solve them (? only here? everywhere?)
    3. summing up
1. Final summary
1. Call to action
    1. call them to do ONE THING only

### 2. Core

1. Target Profile
1. Focus on THEIR Values
1. Select One Spine

### 3. Building blocks

1. Proper Boast
1. Problem -> Solution
1. Objections and Barriers
1. Design points of emotional interest
1. Questions to build relatedness and require Reflection (Kolb)
1. Relevant, Helpful, Organized, Personal, Engaging, Detailed, Unique
