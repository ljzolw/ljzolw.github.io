## Steps

### STEP 1: Ideation

#### 1. Stakeholders

For every Stakeholder type, separately:

1. who are they? What is their story?
2. what do they DO?
3. are they our CUSTOMER or NOT (while being a STAKEHOLDER)? In which regards?
4. functional, emotional, social
5. what is in this product for THEM (probably filled past 'point 3')

#### 2. Vision

1. what do I want out of it?
1. what do they want out of it?
    1. where is the **CARROT**? (better world)
    1. where is the **PAIN**? (current reality or fear)
    1. where is the difference between _now_ and _ideal state_?
        1. this is called a 'gap', uses carrots and pain
1. what do I want for our relation?
1. what do I absolutely NOT want?
1. how do I fill the gap?

#### 3. Values

1. what problem are we solving, really?
    1. remember that 'gap' thing? Select a proper subset
    2. you WANT to identify all objections / barriers, too
1. what are the dimensions?
    1. -ilities; do not overoptimize and kill the product
1. what do we want to achieve?
    1. in other words, OBJECTIVES.
1. how can we quantify all that?
    1. quantify the Values
1. you MAY prioritize if you have too much here
    1. Impact Estimation Table or easier - Eisenhower

#### 4. Validation

1. did it resonate with the target group?
1. did it actually solve a problem we tried to solve?
1. can they name what it did?
1. did we have "you're right" (bad) or "that's right" (good) moment?
1. did the focus group listen (bad) or ask questions and relate to their issues (good)?

#### 5. Proof

1. how will they know they have received value?
1. how can they see the newfound knowledge was useful?

### STEP 2: Design

(apply those perpendicularly; as complete crossection)

#### 1. Skeleton

1. Agenda, Teaser, Story
1. Spine (Topic 1 solving a Problem)
    1. Problem -> Solution
    2. "what if..." leading to Topic 2
1. Supporting Topic 2
    1. Problem -> Solution
    2. "what if..." leading to Topic 3
1. Closing Topic 3
    1. Problem -> Solution
    2. Add some barriers and solve them (? only here? everywhere?)
    3. summing up
1. Final summary
1. Call to action
    1. call them to do ONE THING only

#### 2. Core

1. Target Profile
1. Focus on THEIR Values
1. Select One Spine

#### 3. Building blocks

1. Proper Boast
1. Problem -> Solution
1. Objections and Barriers
1. Design points of emotional interest
1. Questions to build relatedness and require Reflection (Kolb)
1. Relevant, Helpful, Organized, Personal, Engaging, Detailed, Unique

## Example

### STEP 1: Ideation

#### 1. Stakeholders

.1. **Organizers**

Annie is a 28 years old conference organizer. She does it voluntarily; she really likes her hobby and wants everyone to have fun. What she does is not really visible if it works – buildings, security, program. She is our customer because she is the one who accepts the program the first place. Functionally, she needs to have the program filled. Emotionally, she needs to be sure we will not be a problem for her. Socially, she's afraid we might suck.

To make it work, we need to make sure that Annie is not afraid of inviting us for the presentation. Any type of social proof or emotional assurance would be perfect.

.2. **Participants - GMs**

Barbara is a game master. She used to play a lot, but sadly lately life got in the way. Secretly, Barbara is afraid that she is not as good of a game master as she thought. A new player came to the group and it was horrible. What she does – prepare everything, manage the campaign... And she feels all of that is her responsibility.

She's our customer. She doesn't necessary understand why sessions with other people whom she likes suck while her sessions with the people she has every day do not suck. She doesn't understand why some people go out of their way and spoil the session and she thinks it is her fault. Functionally, she wants her sessions to work better. She wants her players to have more fun. Emotionally, she is scared and tired; she doesn't really understand what is going on. Socially, it is always her fault.

To make it work, we have to show some management tools (yes, really) - expectations, managing those, requirement extraction and some tools designed around organizational culture building. We need to prove her that she is not doing it _wrong_, but the group might not be aligned properly. Alignment. That is the word.

.3. **Participants - Players**

Crystal is a 33 years old engineer. She likes playing on conventions and with her static group, too. She likes playing Warhammer; however some groups with Warhammer are cool and some are horrible. This sucks - she volunteers to explain to people why they are playing wrong, but they don't seem to listen.

Emotionally, Crystal is irritated at the RPG world - those people suck. She likes playing, but she likes role players less and less every day. Socially, her group of people she can play with is getting smaller and smaller...

She is our customer – she will understand that organizational culture is a responsibility of everyone and that she doesn't have to play with everyone she meets. It's like computer game clans - some clans suit you more, some less. Adapt or change the clan.

To make it work, I need to prove different play styles and that organizational culture can be shaped by the processes. That people can predefine things and then she won't waste her time by entering the groups which suck.

.4. **Participants - Casuals**

Diane is a 15 years old girl, who wasn't really into role-playing games at this point. She might be slightly interested in that but she has heard some stories... Either of some hard-core guys or those that require 20 hours of your day..? In other words, she doesn't know what to expect and that is something strange. For her, RPG competes against other forms of fun and against Null. What most people of human species, however, would like is to have a group of friends. And this is where RPG might be interesting for her. So: she doesn't do anything, but she might want to find a group of people she'd feel she would like to do something with.

She is our customer, because we can show her that there are many different groups playing RPGs and many different styles – she can find something she likes the most.

To make it work, we actually have to create a market. Show her that there are many different playing styles with different requirements. That this is a game having multiple facets, dependent on the people around.

#### 2. Vision

My goal here is twofold:

1. Create a market - there's more to life than D&D or Warhammer
2. Position myself as an expert in role-playing matters
3. Create some ACTIVE contacts
4. (added) Understand Diane. Why doesn't she play, why would she like to, what are her barriers.

Their goals here are as follows:

1. Organizer - Annie
    1. F: Have the program completed with all lectures.
    2. E: Have everything without any problems. She has enough problems. No busywork. (avoiding pain)
    3. S: make the conference famous (carrot), avoid having "omg so bad conference" Facebook thingies (pain)
    4. Ideally, every presentation is perfect, she gets lots of good speakers and no busywork – everything in deadlines etc.
2. GM - Barbara
    1. F: Do the RPG sessions, preparations, management... all that so her sessions are BETTER and people have more fun.
    2. E: She's exhausted of all that unpaid work (pain), she feels that everything is her fault (pain), wants better RPG sessions (carrot)
    3. S: She wants to be recognized that she is a great GM (carrot), she wants to have more GOOD people playing with her (carrot).
    4. Ideally, she is recognized to be a great GM, her sessions are a blast and she always knows what to do in complex situations (interpersonal)
3. Player - Crystal
    1. F: Play a lot of role-playing games. Preferably fun ones.
    2. E: Have the feeling that RPG is dying and she is the last one (pain), still has fun playing with appropriate people (carrot)
    3. S: Reconnect to RPG world (carrot), has more players to play with (carrot)
    4. Ideally, every RPG session she is present at is perfect. Also, he has a glut of people to play with.
4. Casual - Diane
    1. F: none
    2. E: she needs to feel safe and "not-too-nerdy" (pain), she will feel good understanding why different people speak of such differences (carrot, WEAK)
    3. S: she can find a group she will be a close part of (carrot)
    4. Ideally, she will find a nice group of people who will take care of her and will find her fun

From the above it seems Diane is not well understood by the creator of this product (presentation) yet. Requires more analysis. Added to goals.

What for our relation? I want them to recognize me as an expert, but I don't want this to be "cold". I want some hot contacts. What I do not want, absolutely?

1. "OMG THIS IS SO HARD RPG TOO HARD" - scare potential market
2. "Ok. Time to go to Warhammer... there are no problems there..." - scare potential market
3. "This guy has no idea what he is talking about, he sucks" - be perceived as idiot OR braggart

How do I want to fill the gap? By a very exciting presentation which is going to prove them what is behind the light...

#### 3. Values

What to achieve? (repeating):

1. Create a market - there's more to life than D&D or Warhammer
2. Position myself as an expert in role-playing matters
3. Create some ACTIVE contacts
4. (added) Understand Diane. Why doesn't she play, why would she like to, what are her barriers. -> optional for presentation

Problems to solve in the cascading sequence:

**Keyword**: TO ALIGN THE GROUP TOWARDS THE GOAL

for A: gap "this presentation is going to be excellent"

1. **"Why those groups suck?!"** into
    1. B: gap: "not everything is your fault" - consolation
    2. C: gap: "so I was RIGHT something is off!" - validation
    3. D: gap: "you can find people you like" - hope
2. **"How to CHECK how those groups play"** into
    1. B: gap: "build the culture you want to have / share" - hope
    2. C: gap: "ask them proper questions" - potential Call to Action to try
    3. D: gap: "you can avoid groups you dislike" - potential Call to Action to try
3. **"How to set expectations (and build them in!) how to play"**
    1. B: gap: "THIS is how rules work, THIS is how to manage, THIS is how to make RPG sessions potentially better aligned" - potential Call to Action to try
    2. C: gap: "THIS is how it all works" - proof
    3. D: gap: "THIS is how much different games work" - understanding, inspiration?

Objections, barriers:

* RPG mechanics suck, only golden rule
* OMG I will be a "bad GM / player", no authority, can't do it
* But we always play Warhammer!
* It's a lot of work...

Dimensions:

* presentation excellence:
    * influences goals of A and my positioning
    * quantified by amount of interaction, queue after presentation and hot leads
* market creation:
    * influences my core goals
    * quantified by potential hot leads, buzz in the social media and hot leads
* teaching effectiveness:
    * influences (B, C, D) gaps
    * quantified by amount of questions, reflections, how much did they use it
    * requires LOTS of proofs and examples

#### 4. Validation

Tested the pitch against one RPG player outside of my group. I got the "I might come to this conference then" reaction, with some questions and definite interest.

Seems there exists a target group for this one.

#### 5. Proof

1. Examples SHALL be related to things they have seen while playing. The solutions presented SHALL be universal and SHOULD solve the examples.
2. This is a RPG convention presentation. They need to have fun.
3. I will ask for a case from the audience and I shall solve it, as an example.
